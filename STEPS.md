server.js

```
create API server to make API calls to get the datas we need
```

we set up 2 APIs in server.js

# 1. retrieve the top 100 cryptocurrency

# 2. retrieve overall crytocurrency data

how environment work?
then we run both webpack and APi server concurrently.
since both server runs in different origins. we set up our proxies for our client APIs to make request to the server
